## About Me
#### Hello there, I'm Ikoojo. I'm a Nigerian software developer living in Abuja, Nigeria with a professional exprience building applications with React, Next.js and Sanity CMS. I've been coding for more than three years. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, i knew i was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never just been “just a job” for me, it offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skill in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.
###### 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript <br>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a React.js/Next.js Project
